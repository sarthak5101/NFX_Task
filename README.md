#  NFX Tasks

The provided code showcases the use of the MediaPipe library to perform object detection and pose landmark detection on images. Let's break down the code step by step and explain each part:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
    ```python
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    from google.colab import files
    import mediapipe as mp
    from mediapipe.tasks import python
    from mediapipe.tasks.python import vision
    from mediapipe.framework.formats import landmark_pb2
    ```

    The code begins by importing necessary libraries like OpenCV (`cv2`), NumPy (`np`), and MediaPipe (`mediapipe`). The code also imports modules related to handling files in Google Colab (`files`) and specific modules from MediaPipe for object detection and pose landmark detection (`python` and `vision`).

2. **Setting Constants:**
    ```python
    MARGIN = 10
    ROW_SIZE = 10
    FONT_SIZE = 1
    FONT_THICKNESS = 1
    TEXT_COLOR = (255, 0, 0)
    ```

    These constants define the visual appearance of the annotations drawn on the image during object detection.

3. **Visualize Function:**
    ```python
    def visualize(image, detection_result):
        # ...
        return image
    ```

    This function takes an image and a detection result from the object detection task and annotates the image with bounding boxes and labels for the detected objects. The `visualize` function loops through each detected object, extracts its bounding box and category information, and then draws a colored bounding box and label text on the image using OpenCV functions. The function returns the annotated image.

4. **File Upload and Image Handling:**
    ```python
    uploaded = files.upload()
    for filename in uploaded:
        content = uploaded[filename]
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(content)
    if len(uploaded.keys()):
        IMAGE_FILE = next(iter(uploaded))
        print('Uploaded file:', IMAGE_FILE)
    ```

    This section allows you to upload an image in a Google Colab environment. The uploaded image is stored temporarily, and its file name is printed. The image file path is used later for processing.

5. **Object Detection Setup and Processing:**
    ```python
    base_options = python.BaseOptions(model_asset_path='efficientdet.tflite')
    options = vision.ObjectDetectorOptions(base_options=base_options,
                                           score_threshold=0.5)
    detector = vision.ObjectDetector.create_from_options(options)

    image = mp.Image.create_from_file(IMAGE_FILE)
    detection_result = detector.detect(image)
    ```

    Here, an object detection model based on EfficientDet is set up using MediaPipe's `ObjectDetector`. The model's base options and detection threshold are defined. An image is loaded from the provided file path, and object detection is performed using the `detect` method. The results are stored in the `detection_result` variable.

6. **Annotating Object Detection Results:**
    ```python
    image_copy = np.copy(image.numpy_view())
    annotated_image = visualize(image_copy, detection_result)
    rgb_annotated_image = cv2.cvtColor(annotated_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    cv2_imshow(rgb_annotated_image)
    ```

    The detected objects in the image are visualized by creating an annotated image using the `visualize` function defined earlier. The annotated image is then converted to RGB format and displayed using OpenCV's `cv2_imshow` function.

7. **Pose Landmark Detection Setup and Processing:**
    ```python
    base_options = python.BaseOptions(model_asset_path='pose_landmarker.task')
    options = vision.PoseLandmarkerOptions(
        base_options=base_options,
        output_segmentation_masks=True)
    detector = vision.PoseLandmarker.create_from_options(options)

    image = mp.Image.create_from_file("image.jpg")
    detection_result = detector.detect(image)
    ```

    Similar to object detection, a pose landmark detection model is set up using MediaPipe's `PoseLandmarker`. The model's base options and configuration are defined. An image is loaded, and pose landmark detection is performed using the `detect` method. The results are stored in the `detection_result` variable.

8. **Annotating Pose Landmark Detection Results:**
    ```python
    annotated_image = draw_landmarks_on_image(image.numpy_view(), detection_result)
    cv2_imshow(cv2.cvtColor(annotated_image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))
    ```

    Although the `draw_landmarks_on_image` function is empty in the provided code, it is presumably intended to perform the visualization of pose landmarks on the image. However, since the implementation is missing, this part doesn't show the actual visualization of pose landmarks.

In summary, the provided code demonstrates how to use MediaPipe's object detection and pose landmark detection functionalities to analyze and visualize images. It outlines the process of setting up models, loading images, detecting objects and landmarks, and displaying annotated images with the detection results.
